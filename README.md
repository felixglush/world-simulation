# Station Control

A Python simulation for testing an AI crew's decisions under equipment failures and misleading reports. See [the project specification](docs/station-control.md).

## Development setup

Use Python 3.12 and the locked dependencies:

```bash
bash scripts/setup-cloud.sh
```

Use this same command as the Codex Cloud install command. It installs uv 0.12.21 when needed, syncs dependencies, and runs offline SDK, lint, and formatting checks. The simulator and behavioral tests are still to be built.

For live experiments, supply `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` through the environment and allow HTTPS access to `openrouter.ai`. Both Jev and the captain use OpenRouter. `.env.example` documents the planned model configuration; it is not automatically loaded. Select a captain model with tool calling when implementing its adapter.

## Optional Docker checks

Cloud setup runs directly in its provided environment. Docker gives local development an additional Linux verification path:

```bash
docker build --pull -t world-simulation:dev .
docker run --rm world-simulation:dev
docker run --rm world-simulation:dev uv run --frozen ruff check .
docker run --rm world-simulation:dev uv run --frozen ruff format --check .
```

`docker build` packages the dependencies and scripts into an image. `docker run --rm` starts a temporary container and removes it when the command exits. These checks need no API key. Rebuild after changing files; the image contains a snapshot of the checkout.

## Worktree cleanup

Archive completed Codex-managed worktrees through Codex's archive action. It saves a recoverable Git snapshot before removing the checkout. Export any needed ignored files, such as `runs/`, first; they are not included in that snapshot.

Docker check containers remove themselves with `--rm`. We have no background services or per-worktree Docker resources yet; add a scoped teardown command when those are introduced.
